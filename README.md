Not affiliated with Youtube or Google in any way.

Lightweight Youtube video-aggregation/playlist app for Android. Standalone, not integrated with Youtube. Works by entering a video ID. Can edit your own data you want to store about videos. Also supports actually watching the videos!

## To use
First, take the ID of a video you want to store in your library.
![Shows a form for adding a Youtube video to your personal library, using a video ID, and a user-set title and uploader name. There is a blank screen in place of a Youtube video.](./demo1.png)

Then, if you exit out of the form, you will see the video name and creator's name that you set for the video in your recycler view. 
![Shows a mostly-empty list, with a single entry at the top displaying "Java & Spring Boot Tutorial" and "FreeCodeCamp".](./demo2.png)

Then if you select your new entry, you'll see the data that you set, and be able to watch the video from there.
![Shows the same form as before, but this time there is a working, loading video in place of the previously blank screen.](./demo3.png)
